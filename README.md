# Image Enhancement Using CNNs

**Description:**  
This project focuses on advanced image enhancement techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The methodology integrates Multi-Scale Residual Blocks and Selective Kernel Fusion to address sophisticated image processing tasks. Rigorous preprocessing of diverse datasets ensures high-quality input for achieving robust enhancement outcomes.

**Real-time Uses and Applications:**  
- Medical Imaging Enhancement
- Surveillance Systems Improvement
- Computational Photography Enhancement
- Cinematography and Filmmaking Advancements
- Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Improvement
- Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Traffic Management Optimization
- Reality Enhancement
- Educational Visual Aids Improvement

**Proposed Model:**  
We used an image enhancement model incorporating Multi-Scale Residual Blocks for comprehensive feature extraction and attention mechanisms for effective contextual detail capture. The addition of Selective Kernel Fusion and Recursive Residual Design enables advanced tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, and overall enhancement, as depicted in the diagram below.
